# Fashion Item Classification
Machine Learning model that uses neural network not that much higher but a simple three layer network to classify many of the fashion items.

## Requirements:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
```
pip install tensorflow
```
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
```
pip install keras
```
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
```
pip install numpy
```
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
```
pip install matplotlib
```

## The Data
The data used in this model is [fashion_mnist](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/02/11/fashion-mnist-with-keras-and-deep-learning/), which is coming when you install the keras. And is present in keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
